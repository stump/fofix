The repository has moved to https://github.com/fofix/fofix .

Existing clones can be switched to following fofix/fofix by running the
following command:

  $ git remote set-url origin git://github.com/fofix/fofix.git

If, and only if, you are reading this file because you already pulled
it into your clone, you'll also need to run:

  $ git fetch origin
  $ git reset --hard origin/master

Otherwise you can just pull like normal after you run the first command.

(NOTE: Those last two commands assume you haven't made any changes
yourself that we haven't already merged. Those commands will throw away
such changes. Don't run them if you're just reading this from the GitHub
page and haven't actually pulled this file. If you do have unmerged
changes and don't know what to do, come into IRC and we'll help you.)

See you on the other side!
